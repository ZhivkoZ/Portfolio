This is a blog post in my Portfolio website, and here in my Portfolio website you can find my web projects! To check them- few of my projects are listed in the <a href="http://zhivkoz.github.io/Portfolio/projects/">/projects/</a> page, some of my project are from online courses such as Udemy practices etc., there are also few other websites that I'm still developing- two projects for friends and a Meteor social network that I practice on. I also keep on reading about and studying JavaScript, and JS frameworks like Angular 2, Meteor.

 I accept any suggestions to what I can do better: comment, invite, subscribe.
