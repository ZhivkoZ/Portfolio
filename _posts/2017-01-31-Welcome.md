Hi, this is a blog post in my portfolio website, and here in my portfolio website you can find my web projects! Go ahead and check them- few of my projects are listed in the <a href="http://zhivkoz.github.io/Portfolio/projects/">/projects/</a> page, most of my project are inspired from online lessons such as Udemy practices etc., there are also few other websites that I'm currently working on that I would rather keep to myself for this moment as I don't think they are presentable. I accept any suggestions to what can I do better or make some changes, so feel free to comment. Also I have taken a lot of online courses in the Codecademy website and here is my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/zhivko73656"> profile</a>, also as High Schooler I studied System Programming and I have a third degree professional qualification as a "programmer", also I have a Bachelor Degree from a University in Informatics.
