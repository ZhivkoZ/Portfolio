This is a blog post in my Portfolio website, and here in my Portfolio website you can find my web projects! If you want to check them- few of my projects are listed in the <a href="http://zhivkoz.github.io/Portfolio/projects/">/projects/</a> page, most of my project are from online courses such as Udemy practices etc., there are also few other websites that I'm still developing like this social-network that I practiced on, and found that is very suitable for that role: this is how it looked when I started: <a href= "https://zhivkoz.github.io/Portfolio/static/projects/Old-but-nocomment.PNG">new tab</a>.. was such a long time ago(2y).., and now it looks like this:
<a href="https://zhivkoz.github.io/Portfolio/static/projects/change-is.PNG">new tab </a>also it is on a Heroku hosting: <a href="http://enigmatic-lowlands-70396.herokuapp.com">http://enigmatic-lowlands-70396.herokuapp.com</a>, and here are accounts to login:

 I accept any suggestions to what can I do better or make some changes, so comment, also any job offer or an interview offer, would be highly appreciated as that's why I'm doing this. Also I have taken a lot of online courses in the Codecademy website and here is my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/zhivko73656"> profile</a>, also in High School I studied System Programming, and I have a Bachelor Degree from a University in Informatics.
