This is a blog post in my Portfolio website, and here in the Portfolio website you can find my web projects! To check them- few of my projects are listed in the <a href="http://zhivkoz.github.io/Portfolio/projects/">/projects/</a> page, some of my project are from online courses such as Udemy practices etc., there are also few other websites that I'm still developing. I also keep on studying JavaScript, and even more JavaScript.

 I appreciate any advice on how to become a better developer.

 I have taken a lot of online courses in the Codecademy website and here is my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/zhivko73656"> profile</a>, also in High School I studied System Programming, and I have a Bachelor Degree from a University in Informatics.

 Cheers!
